# Anthony Ditore's portfolio webpage

## Description

I made a portfolio webpage so that a company can view work samples of what I have created.

This project brings potential viewers of the coding work that I have done.

I have learned that to seek out potential work opportunities, I need to be prepared to show them what I can do.

## Usage

Anyone who visits this webpage will be able to navigate through the UI with the header links provided.

They also will be able to follow any links on the page to seperate pages showing off my skills.
